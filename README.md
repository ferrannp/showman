Webpage for the Android app [Showman](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fnp.showman) (Closed beta testing).

# Usage
The app gets data and images from [Trakt.tv](https://trakt.tv/). API calls are proxied using a small [Express server](express-server.js). If you want to try this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Create a ```secrets.js``` file inside the root folder.
2. Inside that file write a constant as such:

```
module.exports = {
  TRAKT_API_KEY: "YOUR_TRAKT_API_KEY"
};
```

You can get your api key here https://trakt.tv/oauth/applications/new.

After that, you can just type ```npm start```and go to ```http://localhost:3000/show/game-of-thrones``` (for example!)

# Testing
Tests are written using [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/), running them is as simple as typing:

```
npm test
```
